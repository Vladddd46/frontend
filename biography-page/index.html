		<h3>Biography:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>23 June 1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London</li>
			
			<li>Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.</li>
			
			<li>Between <strong>January 1922</strong> and <strong>1926</strong>, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant </li>

			<li> In <strong>1926</strong>, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset</li>

			<li>In <strong>1928</strong>, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work, which influenced him a lot.</li>

			<li><strong>1931 - 1934</strong> studied as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge.</li>

			<li><strong>1936</strong> Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".</li>

			<li><strong>September 1936 - July 1938</strong> Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University</li>

			<li><strong>June 1938</strong> he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing</li>

			<li>During <strong>the Second World War</strong>, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park.</li>

			<li>From September <strong>1938</strong>, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.</li>

			<li><strong>8 June 1954</strong>, Turing's housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41; he had died the previous day. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.</li>
